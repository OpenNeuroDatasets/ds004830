{"onset":{"Description":"Onset (in seconds) of the event, measured from the beginning of the acquisition of the first data point stored in the corresponding task data file. Negative onsets are allowed, to account for events that occur prior to the first stored data point. For example, in case there is an in-scanner training phase that begins before the scanning sequence has started events from this sequence should have negative onset time counting down to the beginning of the acquisition of the first volume.\nIf any data points have been discarded before forming the data file (for example, 'dummy volumes' in BOLD fMRI), a time of 0 corresponds to the first stored data point and not the first acquired data point."},"duration":{"Description":"Duration of the event (measured from onset) in seconds. Must always be either zero or positive (or n/a if unavailable). A 'duration' value of zero implies that the delta function or event is so short as to be effectively modeled as an impulse."},"trial_type":{"Description":"Primary categorisation of each trial to identify them as instances of the experimental conditions. For example: for a response inhibition task, it could take on values go and no-go to refer to response initiation and response inhibition experimental conditions."},"value":{"Description":"Marker value associated with the event (for example, the value of a TTL trigger that was recorded at the onset of the event)."}}
